For the task of making the hand spin an object to a target orientation, the reward function could consider the alignment between the current orientation of the object and the target orientation. Calculating the degree of alignment between the two quaternions (representing orientations) can effectively guide the agent towards the correct rotation. You can use the dot product of the normalized quaternions as a measure, which is related to the cosine of the angle difference between the orientations.

Here's a TorchScript-compatible reward function for this task:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(object_rot: torch.Tensor, goal_rot: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Ensure the input quaternions are on the same device
    device = object_rot.device

    # Normalize the input quaternions (to ensure they are valid rotations)
    object_rot_norm = torch.nn.functional.normalize(object_rot, dim=-1)
    goal_rot_norm = torch.nn.functional.normalize(goal_rot, dim=-1)

    # Calculating the cosine of the angle difference using the dot product of quaternions
    alignment = torch.sum(object_rot_norm * goal_rot_norm, dim=-1)

    # Clamping alignment to be in valid range of arccos function [-1, 1]
    alignment = torch.clamp(alignment, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Calculate the reward using the arccos of the absolute alignment (cosine similarity)
    # The smaller the angle, the higher the reward (normalized between -1 and 1 here by the cosine)
    rotation_reward = torch.arccos(alignment)

    # Converting reward to be more sensitive around the target; use a negative exponential to shape it
    temperature = 0.1  # temperature to shape the reward sensitivity
    shaped_reward = torch.exp(-rotation_reward / temperature)

    # Combine the shaped reward components into a total reward
    total_reward = torch.sum(shaped_reward)

    # Debugging, return individual components
    reward_components = {
        "alignment_raw": alignment,
        "rotation_cost": rotation_reward,
        "shaped_reward": shaped_reward
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
```

This function outputs both the total reward and a dictionary of each individual reward component. The temperature parameter of `0.1` shapes the reward function, making it more sensitive to errors as the agent's orientation of the object approaches the target orientation. This should help to guide the policy effectively when learning to rotate the object to the desired target orientation mentioned in the task. Adjusting this parameter may be necessary depending on other factors like the learning rate or scale of the task.

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Based on the provided policy feedback and the effectiveness of the reward function, it's clear from the `shaped_reward` outputs that the exponential shaping with the currently set temperature parameter leads to values remaining at zeroes. This indicates that the temperature parameter `0.1` might be too low, causing the shaped reward to vanish even for minor deviations in orientation.

To improve the reward function, I will adjust the temperature parameter and simplify the reward function, aiming for a direct, interpretable influence that effectively scales the reward signal regarding the agent's performance. Here's an updated version of the reward function:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(object_rot: torch.Tensor, goal_rot: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Normalize the input quaternions (to ensure they are valid rotations)
    object_rot_norm = torch.nn.functional.normalize(object_rot, dim=-1)
    goal_rot_norm = torch.nn.functional.normalize(goal_rot, dim=-1)

    # Calculating the dot product of quaternions as an alignment measure
    alignment = torch.sum(object_rot_norm * goal_rot_norm, dim=-1)
    alignment = torch.clamp(alignment, -1.0, 1.0)  # Clamping for safe acos computation

    # Compute the cost as the angular distance (in radians)
    rotation_cost = torch.acos(alignment)

    # Rewriting the reward to amplify useful signals and adjust the temperature
    temperature_rotation = 0.5  # Adjusted temperature for rotation reward
    shaped_rotation_reward = torch.exp(-rotation_cost / temperature_rotation)

    # We can also introduce a squared term to further emphasize precise alignment,
    # as squaring the alignment value will give higher rewards to values closer to 1.
    alignment_squared_reward = alignment**2

    # Final reward combines both shaped reward and squared reward for better learning signal
    total_reward = shaped_rotation_reward + alignment_squared_reward

    # Debugging, return individual reward components
    reward_components = {
        "alignment_raw": alignment,
        "rotation_cost": rotation_cost,
        "shaped_rotation_reward": shaped_rotation_reward,
        "alignment_squared_reward": alignment_squared_reward
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
```

This new reward function uses an adjusted temperature for the exponential shaped reward and adds a squared term for the alignment to provide stronger incentives for almost correct orientations. By combining these two, the agent receives a more gradual and informative reward structure across varying degrees of alignment, aiding in stabilizing learning and providing a clearer gradient for improvements.

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Based on the detailed feedback of the policy outcomes using the reward function, the following observations can guide the adjustments in the reward function:

1. **Success and episode length scales** suggest progress in policy but indicate that further tuning might be required for consistency in achieving high success rates.
2. **Low variability in some components** (e.g., `shaped_rotation_reward`) suggests that perhaps the transformation applied (like exponential scaling) is either too strong or not receptive enough to subtle changes in the observed behavior.
3. **Overall spread and scaling** of different components suggest that realignment or rescaling might be necessary to finely tune the components' effects on the total reward.

Given these insights, adjustments can be made:

- **Softening the exponential `shaped_rotation_reward`** by adjusting its temperature parameter to improve responsiveness.
- **Redefining scaling or absolute transformation** for components like `alignment_raw` to ensure their contribution is more dynamically adjusted based on observed behavior.
- **Combining reward components** to create a balanced influence from both alignment magnitude and rotation cost.

Here's an improved reward function, adopting these strategies:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(object_rot: torch.Tensor, goal_rot: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Normalize quaternions to ensure they are valid rotations
    object_rot_norm = torch.nn.functional.normalize(object_rot, dim=-1)
    goal_rot_norm = torch.nn.functional.normalize(goal_rot, dim=-1)

    # Calculation of dot product for alignment measure
    alignment = torch.sum(object_rot_norm * goal_rot_norm, dim=-1)
    alignment = torch.clamp(alignment, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensuring safe range for acos

    # Angular distance in radians for rotation cost
    rotation_cost = torch.acos(alignment)

    # Adjusted temperature for rotation reward transformation
    temperature_rotation = 0.7  # Slightly increased temperature for more responsiveness
    shaped_rotation_reward = torch.exp(-rotation_cost / temperature_rotation)

    # Adjustment in squared alignment for stronger emphasis on closer alignments
    alignment_squared_reward = alignment**2

    # Combine components proportionately
    total_reward = 0.8 * shaped_rotation_reward + 0.2 * alignment_squared_reward

    # Collecting reward components for debugging
    reward_components = {
        "alignment_raw": alignment,
        "rotation_cost": rotation_cost,
        "shaped_rotation_reward": shaped_rotation_reward,
        "alignment_squared_reward": alignment_squared_reward
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
```

This version:
- Modifies the temperature of the exponential scaling for better sensitivity to changes in orientation.
- Adjusts the blend of shaped and squared rewards to emphasize near-perfect outcomes, aiming to guide the agent with a gradation in rewards for proximity to optimal alignment.
- Provides a balanced overall reward composition that considers both systematic learning through shaped reward and immediate correction through alignment emphasis.

From the performance and feedback of previous reward function trials, it appears some components need adjustment. Here's a careful analysis and a newly improved reward function addressing these insights:

1. **`alignment_raw` and `rotation_cost`** - These metrics show nuance changes across training epochs, yet a significant rise from their initial values. This suggests the agent is somewhat learning to reduce rotational discrepancies but inconsistently, potentially due to a lack of direct emphasis.
   
2. **`shaped_rotation_reward`** - The values for this reward reflect improvements but are capped; implying the exponential scaling using the temperature might need adjusting. This restricts the range so much that it limits a gradient sufficient for effective learning.

3. **`alignment_squared_reward`** - This component shows progress but stabilizes early, suggesting it could be leveraged more effectively by increasing the reward sensitivity as the alignment improves.

Given the observations, the updated reward function seeks to enhance sensitivity to rotational alignment and provides stronger incentives for near-correct orientations, thereby encouraging a more precise policy outcome.

Here's the code for the improved reward function:

```python
import torch

### Key Adjustments:
- **Reduced `temperature_rotation`**: This makes the exponential decay less steep, which is favorable for gradually improving outputs, providing a smoother learning gradient.
- **Introduced `alignment_exponential`**: By raising alignment to the fourth power, the reward becomes highly sensitive to finer adjustments as the alignment approaches one, effectively encouraging more precise orientation behavior.
- **Adjusted weights**: The rebalance prioritizes the rotation quality over just approximations, driving the agent towards more accurate orientations for higher scores. 

This combination aims to direct the learning more explicitly towards minor improvements in alignment, which are crucial for tasks requiring high precision, embedded into the feedback of the shaped rewards.

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Based on the feedback data provided from the previous reward function trials, there are a few areas that could be improved to enhance learning effectiveness:

1. **Tuning of Temperature Parameters**: The 'shaped_rotation_reward' showed marked changes initially but then plateaued early, suggesting that maybe the temperature parameter used for exponential scaling is either too lenient or too stringent, affecting the gradient provided for learning. 

2. **Scaling and Impact of Alignment Components**: While 'alignment_exponential' shows some variation, its impact seems muted compared to 'shaped_rotation_reward', suggesting that the impact of closer alignment is under-rewarded. Improving the sensitivity and potential rewards for fine alignments might encourage the policy towards more exact orientation matching.

Here is the improved reward function with re-adjusted temperature and scaling parameters to better leverage the tuning for precise alignment:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_new_reward(object_rot: torch.Tensor, goal_rot: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Normalize quaternions to ensure valid rotations
    object_rot_norm = torch.nn.functional.normalize(object_rot, dim=-1)
    goal_rot_norm = torch.nn.functional.normalize(goal_rot, dim=-1)

    # Compute dot product to check alignment
    alignment = torch.sum(object_rot_norm * goal_rot_norm, dim=-1)
    alignment = torch.clamp(alignment, -1.0, 1.0)  # Clamping to ensure valid inputs for acos

    # Calculate the rotation cost based on the angle difference
    rotation_cost = torch.acos(alignment)
    
    # Shaping rotation reward with updated temperature parameter for more gradient
    rotation_temperature = 0.35
    shaped_rotation_reward = torch.exp(-rotation_cost / rotation_temperature)

    # Incorporating an exponential version of the alignment for granularity in fine tuning
    fine_alignment_weight = 5.0
    fine_alignment_reward = alignment.pow(10) * fine_alignment_weight

    # Combining components with a new balance
    total_reward = 0.6 * shaped_rotation_reward + 0.4 * fine_alignment_reward

    # Reward components for detailed monitoring
    reward_components = {
        "alignment_raw": alignment,
        "rotation_cost": rotation_cost,
        "shaped_rotation_reward": shaped_rotation_reward,
        "fine_alignment_reward": fine_alignment_reward
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
```

### Adjustments Made:
- **Reduced `rotation_temperature`**: A lower temperature for the `shaped_rotation_reward` makes the gradient steeper, allowing the agent to be more responsive to changes in rotational alignment.
- **Introduced `fine_alignment_reward`**: By raising alignment to the 10th power and adding a scaling factor, this reward emphasizes nearly perfect alignments more explicitly and gives an exponential increase in reward for highly precise alignments, which can drive learning towards achieving exact goal orientations.
- **Adjusted balance of components**: By giving more significant weight to the fine alignment reward, the agent is encouraged more strongly to achieve near-perfect alignments, which are crucial in tasks demanding high precision such as object manipulation using robotic hands.

Analyzing the policy feedback:

1. **Alignment Raw**: The values of 'alignment_raw' started lower and improved over time, showing that the agent learned to align the object's rotation better with the target. However, it never reached very high values, suggesting possible improvements.

2. **Rotation Cost**: This component seems to be working correctly as it tends to decrease, indicating the rotation distance is reducing over time. However, the mean and maximum suggest that the policy struggles in some scenarios to reduce this value further. 

3. **Shaped Rotation Reward**: The rewards range from quite low to moderate, suggesting that the exponential transformation might be too harsh or rapid.

4. **Fine Alignment Reward**: The response to this reward component is relatively high, indicating that it might be overpowering other components, thus skewing the optimization focus.

Reflecting on these observations, we should make the following improvements:
- Increase the impact of the `rotation_cost` to improve precise orientation.
- Adjust the exponential transformation for `shaped_rotation_reward` to a less steep curve.
- Balance the weights between `shaped_rotation_reward` and `fine_alignment_reward` to ensure that both rotation alignment and fine orientation are equally emphasized.

Here is the revised reward function integrating these suggested changes:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_improved_reward(object_rot: torch.Tensor, goal_rot: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Normalize quaternions to ensure valid rotations
    object_rot_norm = torch.nn.functional.normalize(object_rot, dim=-1)
    goal_rot_norm = torch.nn.functional.normalize(goal_rot, dim=-1)

    # Compute dot product to check alignment
    alignment = torch.sum(object_rot_norm * goal_rot_norm, dim=-1)
    alignment = torch.clamp(alignment, -1.0, 1.0)  # Clamping to ensure valid inputs for acos

    # Calculate the rotation cost based on the angle difference
    rotation_cost = torch.acos(alignment)
    
    # Adjust temperature for a less steep curve
    rotation_temperature = 0.45
    shaped_rotation_reward = torch.exp(-rotation_cost / rotation_temperature)

    # Fine alignment reward adjusted for balance
    fine_alignment_weight = 2.0
    fine_alignment_reward = alignment.pow(8) * fine_alignment_weight  # Reduced the power for less sensitivity

    # Combining components with new balance
    total_reward = 0.5 * shaped_rotation_reward + 0.5 * fine_alignment_reward  # Equal weighting for components

    # Reward components for detailed monitoring
    reward_components = {
        "alignment_raw": alignment,
        "rotation_cost": rotation_cost,
        "shaped_rotation_reward": shaped_rotation_reward,
        "fine_alignment_reward": fine_alignment_reward
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
```

### Changes:
- **Rotation Temperature**: Adjusted from 0.35 to 0.45 to soften the steepness of the exponential drop-off.
- **Fine Alignment Reward**: The exponential power was reduced from 10 to 8, and the weight from 5.0 to 2.0 to prevent the fine alignment from overpowering other reward components.
- **Balanced Weights**: The total reward calculation now gives equal importance to both primary components, encouraging the agent to optimize both aspects of the task simultaneously.

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

The provided feedback on the reward function components shows that some improvements are needed to better optimize the policy:

1. **alignment_raw** seems to increase over epochs implying improvement in alignment, but there's still room for enhanced sensitivity.
2. **rotation_cost** is reducing, which is good. However, its associated sharp reward, `shaped_rotation_reward`, has not reached very high values. Adjusting the temperature might help.
3. **fine_alignment_reward** has very high values compared to other components, potentially causing an imbalance in reward signaling.

Given the above considerations, we'll adjust the existing reward components to increase the learning efficiency and balance:

1. **Shaped Rotation Reward**: Increase the temperature parameter to soften the response curve.
2. **Fine Alignment Reward**: Decrease influence by reducing power and adjust the scaling or weighting.
3. **Overall Scaling**: Ensure that each reward component is more balanced relative to the others.

Below is the improved reward function code based on this analysis:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_improved_reward_v2(object_rot: torch.Tensor, goal_rot: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    object_rot_norm = torch.nn.functional.normalize(object_rot, dim=-1)
    goal_rot_norm = torch.nn.functional.normalize(goal_rot, dim=-1)

    # Compute dot product for alignment
    alignment = torch.sum(object_rot_norm * goal_rot_norm, dim=-1)
    alignment = torch.clamp(alignment, -1.0, 1.0)

    # Compute the rotation cost
    rotation_cost = torch.acos(alignment)

    # Adjust the temperature for the rotation reward
    rotation_temperature = 0.6
    shaped_rotation_reward = torch.exp(-rotation_cost / rotation_temperature)

    # Adjust the fine alignment reward mechanism
    fine_alignment_temperature = 2.0  # Reducing influence
    fine_alignment_reward = torch.pow(alignment, 6.0) * fine_alignment_temperature  # Softened influence

    # Total reward, ensuring an equal balance between the components
    total_reward = 0.5 * shaped_rotation_reward + 0.5 * fine_alignment_reward

    # Logging reward components for debugging and monitoring
    reward_components = {
        "alignment_raw": alignment,
        "rotation_cost": rotation_cost,
        "shaped_rotation_reward": shaped_rotation_reward,
        "fine_alignment_reward": fine_alignment_reward
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
```

### Changes Made:
- **rotation_temperature** increased from 0.45 to 0.6 to provide a less rapid drop-off, which should allow the network to learn finer degrees of orientation better.
- **fine_alignment_reward**: Reduced the power from 8 to 6 and adjusted the temperature, aimed at reducing its previously overwhelming effect compared to other rewards.
- The balance now evenly weights `shaped_rotation_reward` and `fine_alignment_reward`, which was previously potentially biased towards one or the other. This should create more equilibrium in learning signals.

This reformulated reward function intends to more effectively drive the agent towards achieving the target orientation while maintaining a balance between precision and alignment.
